                        <h2>Statistics</h2>
                    </div>

                    <div class="About__Heading__Description">
                        <p>The most important aspect of any Data Science approach is how the information is processed.
                            When we talk about developing insights out of data it is basically digging out the
                            possibilities. Those possibilities in Data Science are known as Statistical Analysis.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Most of us wonder how can data in the form of text, images, videos, and other highly
                            unstructured formats get easily processed by Machine Learning models. But, the truth is we
                            actually convert that data into a numerical form which is not exactly our data but the
                            numerical equivalent of it. So, this brings us to the very important aspect of Data Science.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>With data in numerical format, it provides us with infinite possibilities to understand the
                            information out it. Statistics acts as a pathway to understand your data and process that
                            for successful results. Not only the power of statistics is limited to understanding the
                            data it also provides methods to measure the success of our insights, getting different
                            approaches for the same problem, getting the right mathematical approach for your data.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Understanding Statistics</h2>
                        <p>Statistics are used in virually all the scientific discilines, such as physical and social
                            science as well as in bussines, the humanities, government, and manufacturing.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Importance of Statistics for Data Science</h2>

                        <p>Most Data Scientist always invest more in pre-processing of data. This requies a good
                            undersstanding of statistics. There are few genral steps that alwaus need to be performed to
                            preocess any data.</p>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1. Identify the Importance of features by using various statistical tests.</li>
                            <li>2. Finding the relationship between features to eliminate the possibility of duplicate
                                features.</li>
                            <li>Converting the features into the required format.</li>
                            <li>Normalizing and scaling the data. This step also involves the identification of the
                                distribution of data and the nature of data.</li>
                            <li>Taking the data for further processing by using requied adjustments in the data.</li>
                            <li>After processing the data identify the right mathematical approach/model.</li>
                            <li>Once the results are obtained the results are verified on the different accuracy
                                measurement scales</li>
                            <br>
                            <p>The data processing from the beginning to the end of the complete cycle there is a
                                requirement of statistics at every single step. That's why a good statistician can be a
                                good Data Scientist as well.</p>

                        <h2>Guide to Learn Statistics</h2>
                    </div>

                    <div class="About__Heading__Description">
                        <p>It is always requied to understand every fundamental of Statistics. However, most people are not very clear about where to start.</p>

                        <p>These are the few key concepts that are requied to pace up and understand the fundatmentals of Statisitcs for Data Science.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Probability</h2>
                        <p>Probability is the basic need for understanding the possibilities. To start with let us take a very basic example - What are the chances that Team A is going to win the footabll match against Team B. To derive this anser we might requie 100 people to give their respective votes - Number of Samples. Based on those votes we can have a chance of which team can win the game.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>But in this example, we come across another very important concept which is known as sampling - identifying the right set of people to vote for the results. So, the probability is the chance of whether the event will occur or not. Depending upon the scenario we can build different solutions around this.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Sampling</h2>
                        <p>The sampling as we discussed in the above example is identifying the right set of people. the question is what are the right set of people. Let's continue our previous example for the above scenario we need those 100 people who have a good knowledge of Football, who knows about the history of Team A and B, who should not be biased towards a team because of their personal preference. So, identifying the right sample can be done by various statistical approaches. There are various types of sampling methods - Simple Random Sampling, Systematic Sampling, Stratified Sampling, Clustered Sampling, etc.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Tendency and Distribution of Data</h2>
                        <p>The distribution of data is a very important aspect. The famous distribution like Normal Distribution is very significant. For example, when we talk about the distribution of height and weight of the world it is normally dostributed data showing the symmetry of nature. The normal distribution has to Mean, Mode and Median all coincide at the central peak. These data are supposed to be very accurate data. So identifying the distribution and skewness of data is a very important concept.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Hypothesis Testing</h2>
                        <p>If we know whether to perform some action or not. Will those actions give a positive result or a negative result then we can have an added advantage of doing the right things. Hypothesis Testing gives identifying the situation where the action should be taken or not based on what results will it produce. these are other tests as well like A/B Testing, Z Test, T-Test, Null Hypothesis with similar relevance.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Variations</h2>
                        <p>When we talk about different variations in data. We talk about the distortion, error, shift in data. Alon, with the variations in data the range of the data, relationship within the dta. All these accounts for the variability of data. Some of the key terms to understand here are - Variance, Range, Standard Deviation, Error Deviation, Covariance, Correlation, Causality, etc.</p>
